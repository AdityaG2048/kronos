pass a file name (if the file is in the current directory) or path to the fil_encryptor.py file while running it and the passed file or folder will be rncrypted.

do the same for the file_decryptor.py to decrypt.

the password_manager.py is under work as of now which just provides a interface and stores/retreives passwords from .csv file without any actual encryption.
